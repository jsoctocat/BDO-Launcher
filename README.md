- Supports automatic login even if the account has set up for OTP system (The password and OTP are both stored locally and encrypted)

## FAQ
*Why was this created?*

Since the official launcher takes a very long time to start and sometimes won't load at all. This custom launcher solves that problem.
This launcher also completely removes the need of having to manually input password or OTP every single time when trying to login.

*Do I still need the official launcher?*

Yes, the official launcher is still required for the weekly game update, this has to be done manually via the official launcher.

*So how does it work exactly?*

The launcher will fetch a handshake from PA (https://launcher.naeu.playblackdesert.com/Login/Index) then sends the necessary credentials (email and password) to PA's authentication server-endpoint (https://account.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Launcher/Login/LoginProcess), in return, gets an authentication token. This authentication token is then sent to PA's second authentication server-endpoint (https://launcher.naeu.playblackdesert.com/Default/AuthenticateAccount) which generates a play token. The launcher then starts the game by creating a process (BlackDesertEAC.exe) with the play token as a startup command-line argument.

*I get an error message/launcher doesn't work at all!*
